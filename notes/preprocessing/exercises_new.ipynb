Specifically, create a file called `'data/nobel-laureates-lines.json'` that has each lauriate's record serialized seprately as a json object, with newlines `'\\n'` in between, as delimiters. As a follow up, combine the line-by-line file reading syntax introduced in Section 1.4.1.5 in conjunction with the `json.dumps()` string serialization function in Section 1.4.2.2 to _read only the first ten lines_. As you read these lines, load each from json and print the laureate's list of prizes.\n",

It seems the 2-digit year reference to `1985` works (can you figure out how `dateparser` determines century?) and as a result determining age becomes as simple as taking a difference with `-` (minus), and dividing the resulting `.days` attribute by 365.25 (accounting for leap years)."
